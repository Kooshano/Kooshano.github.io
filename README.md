## Additional updates
- **Theme-aware logos**: top-left brand and header icon swap automatically between `static/logo-light.svg` and `static/logo-dark.svg`. Replace these files with your preferred dark/light versions.
- **Certificates**: all certificates now use a **gallery** like the Hackathon item. Clicking an image opens the credential directly in a new tab. The preview modal was removed.
- **Consistent headings**: all section titles share the same effect and underline.
- **No white boxes**: content blocks are transparent; typography colors were tuned for high contrast in both themes.
